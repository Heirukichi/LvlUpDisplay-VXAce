## DESCRIPTION
With this script it is possible to show stats window at the end of each battle if an actor gains one level.

## TERMS OF USE
This script is under the GNU General Public License v3.0. This means that:
- You are free to use this script in both commercial and non-commercial games as long as you give proper credits to me (Heirukichi) and provide a link to my website;
- You are free to modify this script as long as you do not pretend you wrote this and you distribute it under the same license as the original.

You can review the full license here
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html
or in the [license file](LICENSE).

In addition I'd like to keep track of games where my scripts are used so, even if this is not mandatory, I'd like you to inform me and send me a link when a game including my script is published.
As I said, this is not mandatory but it really helps me and it is much appreciated.

#### IMPORTANT NOTICE:
If you want to distribute this code, feel free to do it, but provide a link to my website instead of pasting my script somewhere else.

If you are using this script, please keep in mind that the required script is a private script written for Kes (ksjp17). You **CANNOT** use that script if you are not Kes (ksjp17). If you want to use this script in your project and you are not Kes (ksjp17) you have to edit this script so that it can work without Trihan's script.

## INSTRUCTIONS
Copy/paste this script in your project below Matetrials. Be sure to paste it **BELOW** Trihan's script.
You can configure this script changing values in the HRK_WLVLUP module.
Detailed information on each one of those values can be found in the module itself.
